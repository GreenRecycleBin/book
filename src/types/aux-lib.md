# Auxiliary Documentation
_By Jacob Neumann, June 2021_

This page collects the documentation of the [Auxiliary Library](https://github.com/smlhelp/aux-library). The purpose of this library & its documentation is to serve as sample code, proofs, and worked examples for students learning functional programming and/or SML for the first time. Accordingly, this documentation also includes explicit mathematical definitions, proofs by induction, asymptotic analyses, and evaluation traces, as appropriate.

Unless otherwise stated, the documentation assumes SMLNJ v110.99. Some features (e.g. modifications of the pretty printer) might not work in other versions of SMLNJ.

## Permute
The `Permute` module contains utilities for permutating and sorting lists. The functions in this module are polymorphic, and some of the sorting functions furthermore serve as examples of _currying_.
